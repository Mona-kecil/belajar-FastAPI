# FastAPI Learning Roadmap

This roadmap serves as a structured guide to mastering FastAPI, covering its core features, advanced concepts, and deployment.

---

## **Phase 1: Introduction to FastAPI**
- [ ] **Basics of FastAPI**:
  - [ ] Installation and Setup
  - [ ] HelloWorld Application
- [ ] **Understanding Main Features and Benefits**
- [ ] **Comparison with Other Frameworks**:
  - [ ] FastAPI vs Flask/Django (WSGI frameworks)
  - [ ] Key advantages of ASGI over WSGI:
    - [ ] **Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming**
    - [ ] **Real-time Communication Support** (e.g., WebSockets)
    - [ ] Scalability improvements for high I/O workloads

---

## **Phase 2: Understanding ASGI**
- [ ] **What is ASGI?**
  - [ ] Definition: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a modern standard for Python web applications and servers to handle asynchronous capabilities.
  - [ ] Comparison with WSGI:
    - [ ] **WSGI**: Handles synchronous requests; doesn't support WebSockets or async calls.
    - [ ] **ASGI**: Supports asynchronous tasks, WebSockets, HTTP2, and long-lived connections.
  - [ ] Why FastAPI uses ASGI:
    - [ ] Built-in async/await capabilities.
    - [ ] Improved performance for modern APIs.

- [ ] **Deep Dive into ASGI**:
  - [ ] **ASGI Lifecycle**:
    - [ ] The interaction between an ASGI server (e.g., Uvicorn) and an ASGI app (e.g., FastAPI).
    - [ ] **Three main ASGI events**:
      1. **Lifespan Events**: App startup/shutdown lifecycle.
      2. **HTTP Scope**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
      3. **WebSocket Scope**: Real-time two-way communication.
  - [ ] **ASGI Middleware**:
    - [ ] How middleware interacts with requests/responses.
    - [ ] Writing custom middleware for logging, authentication, or request manipulation.

- [ ] **Async vs Traditional Programming**:
  - [ ] **Event Loops**: How FastAPI leverages `asyncio` for concurrency.
  - [ ] **Blocking vs Non-blocking code**:
    - [ ] Examples of synchronous (blocking) vs asynchronous (non-blocking) tasks.
  - [ ] Best practices for using `async def` in FastAPI.

---

## **Phase 3: Core FastAPI Features**
- [ ] **HTTP Verbs and Routing**:
  - [ ] Defining Routes
  - [ ] Route Parameters
  - [ ] Query Parameters
- [ ] **Request and Response Models**:
  - [ ] Pydantic Models
  - [ ] Request Validation
  - [ ] Response Models (encoding, handling)

---

## **Phase 4: Authentication and Authorization**
- [ ] Introduction to OAuth2
- [ ] Implementing Basic Authentication
- [ ] Security Schemes in FastAPI
- [ ] Using `Security` and `Depends`
- [ ] JWT Tokens for Authentication

---

## **Phase 5: Middleware and Error Handling**
- [ ] **Middleware**:
  - [ ] Understanding Middleware
  - [ ] Creating Middleware
  - [ ] Pre and Post Request Hooks
- [ ] **Error Handling**:
  - [ ] HTTP Exceptions
  - [ ] Custom Exception Handlers
- [ ] Middleware Interaction with Requests/Responses

---

## **Phase 6: Dependency Injection**
- [ ] FastAPI's Dependency Injection System
- [ ] Using `Depends` and Sub-dependencies
- [ ] Advanced Use of Dependencies

---

## **Phase 7: Database Interaction**
- [ ] **SQL (Relational) Databases**:
  - [ ] Connection with PostgreSQL
  - [ ] CRUD Operations
- [ ] ORM with SQLModel or SQLAlchemy
- [ ] Database Migrations with Alembic

---

## **Phase 8: Advanced Routing and Features**
- [ ] **Advanced Routing Techniques**:
  - [ ] URL Redirection
  - [ ] Direct Response Generation
  - [ ] Using WebSocket Routes
- [ ] File Uploads and Background Tasks
- [ ] Streaming Responses

---

## **Phase 9: Testing and Debugging**
- [ ] Introduction to `pytest`
- [ ] Testing FastAPI Routes
- [ ] Mocking Dependencies
- [ ] Debugging Tools and Techniques

---

## **Phase 10: Deployment and Scaling**
- [ ] Deployment with Uvicorn/Gunicorn
- [ ] Dockerizing FastAPI Applications
- [ ] Deployment to Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Scaling with Kubernetes
- [ ] Automated Deployment with CI/CD

---

## **Phase 11: Exploring Advanced Concepts**
- [ ] Integration with GraphQL
- [ ] Websocket Development
- [ ] Custom API Route Classes
- [ ] Incorporating Event Handling
