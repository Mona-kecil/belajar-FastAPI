# FastAPI Learning Roadmap

This roadmap serves as a structured guide to mastering FastAPI, covering its core features, advanced concepts, and deployment.

---

## **Phase 1: Introduction to FastAPI**
- [x] **Basics of FastAPI**:
  - [x] Installation and Setup
  - [x] HelloWorld Application
- [x] **Understanding Main Features and Benefits**
- [x] **Comparison with Other Frameworks**:
  - [x] FastAPI vs Flask/Django (WSGI frameworks)
  - [x] Key advantages of ASGI over WSGI:
    - [x] **Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming**
    - [x] **Real-time Communication Support** (e.g., WebSockets)
    - [x] Scalability improvements for high I/O workloads

---

## **Phase 2: Understanding ASGI**
- [x] **What is ASGI?**
  - [x] Definition: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a modern standard for Python web applications and servers to handle asynchronous capabilities.
  - [x] Comparison with WSGI:
    - [x] **WSGI**: Handles synchronous requests; doesn't support WebSockets or async calls.
    - [x] **ASGI**: Supports asynchronous tasks, WebSockets, HTTP2, and long-lived connections.
  - [x] Why FastAPI uses ASGI:
    - [x] Built-in async/await capabilities.
    - [x] Improved performance for modern APIs.
- [x] **Deep Dive into ASGI**:
  - [x] **ASGI Lifecycle**:
    - [x] The interaction between an ASGI server (e.g., Uvicorn) and an ASGI app (e.g., FastAPI).
    - [x] **Three main ASGI events**:
      1. **Lifespan Events**: App startup/shutdown lifecycle.
      2. **HTTP Scope**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
      3. **WebSocket Scope**: Real-time two-way communication.
  - [x] **ASGI Middleware**:
    - [x] How middleware interacts with requests/responses.
    - [x] Writing custom middleware for logging, authentication, or request manipulation.
- [x] **Async vs Traditional Programming**:
  - [x] **Event Loops**: How FastAPI leverages `asyncio` for concurrency.
  - [x] **Blocking vs Non-blocking code**:
    - [x] Examples of synchronous (blocking) vs asynchronous (non-blocking) tasks.
  - [x] Best practices for using `async def` in FastAPI.
