# FastAPI Learning Roadmap

This roadmap serves as a structured guide to mastering FastAPI, covering its core features, advanced concepts, and deployment.

---

## **Phase 1: Introduction to FastAPI**
- [x] **Basics of FastAPI**:
  - [x] Installation and Setup
  - [x] HelloWorld Application
- [x] **Understanding Main Features and Benefits**
- [x] **Comparison with Other Frameworks**:
  - [x] FastAPI vs Flask/Django (WSGI frameworks)
  - [x] Key advantages of ASGI over WSGI:
    - [x] **Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming**
    - [x] **Real-time Communication Support** (e.g., WebSockets)
    - [x] Scalability improvements for high I/O workloads

---

## **Phase 2: Understanding ASGI**
- [x] **What is ASGI?**
  - [x] Definition: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a modern standard for Python web applications and servers to handle asynchronous capabilities.
  - [x] Comparison with WSGI:
    - [x] **WSGI**: Handles synchronous requests; doesn't support WebSockets or async calls.
    - [x] **ASGI**: Supports asynchronous tasks, WebSockets, HTTP2, and long-lived connections.
  - [x] Why FastAPI uses ASGI:
    - [x] Built-in async/await capabilities.
    - [x] Improved performance for modern APIs.
- [x] **Deep Dive into ASGI**:
  - [x] **ASGI Lifecycle**:
    - [x] The interaction between an ASGI server (e.g., Uvicorn) and an ASGI app (e.g., FastAPI).
    - [x] **Three main ASGI events**:
      1. **Lifespan Events**: App startup/shutdown lifecycle.
      2. **HTTP Scope**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
      3. **WebSocket Scope**: Real-time two-way communication.
  - [x] **ASGI Middleware**:
    - [x] How middleware interacts with requests/responses.
    - [x] Writing custom middleware for logging, authentication, or request manipulation.
- [x] **Async vs Traditional Programming**:
  - [x] **Event Loops**: How FastAPI leverages `asyncio` for concurrency.
  - [x] **Blocking vs Non-blocking code**:
    - [x] Examples of synchronous (blocking) vs asynchronous (non-blocking) tasks.
  - [x] Best practices for using `async def` in FastAPI.

---

## **Phase 3: Core FastAPI Features**
- [x] **HTTP Verbs and Routing**:
  - [x] Defining Routes
  - [x] Route Parameters
  - [x] Query Parameters
- [x] **Request and Response Models**:
  - [x] Pydantic Models
  - [x] Request Validation
  - [x] Response Models (encoding, handling)

---

## **Phase 4: Authentication and Authorization**
- [x] Introduction to OAuth2
- [x] Implementing Basic Authentication
- [x] Security Schemes in FastAPI
- [x] Using `Security` and `Depends`
- [x] JWT Tokens for Authentication

---

## **Phase 5: Middleware and Error Handling**
- [x] **Middleware**:
  - [x] Understanding Middleware
  - [x] Creating Middleware
  - [x] Pre and Post Request Hooks
- [x] **Error Handling**:
  - [x] HTTP Exceptions
  - [x] Custom Exception Handlers
- [x] Middleware Interaction with Requests/Responses

---

## **Phase 6: Dependency Injection**
- [x] FastAPI's Dependency Injection System
- [x] Using `Depends` and Sub-dependencies
- [x] Advanced Use of Dependencies

---

## **Phase 7: Database Interaction**
- [ ] **SQL (Relational) Databases**:
  - [ ] Connection with PostgreSQL
  - [ ] CRUD Operations
- [ ] ORM with SQLModel or SQLAlchemy
- [ ] Database Migrations with Alembic

---

## **Phase 8: Advanced Routing and Features**
- [x] **Advanced Routing Techniques**:
  - [x] URL Redirection
  - [x] Direct Response Generation
  - [x] Using WebSocket Routes
- [x] File Uploads and Background Tasks
- [x] Streaming Responses

---

## **Phase 9: Testing and Debugging**
- [ ] Introduction to `pytest`
- [ ] Testing FastAPI Routes
- [ ] Mocking Dependencies
- [ ] Debugging Tools and Techniques

---

## **Phase 10: Deployment and Scaling**
- [ ] Deployment with Uvicorn/Gunicorn
- [ ] Dockerizing FastAPI Applications
- [ ] Deployment to Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Scaling with Kubernetes
- [ ] Automated Deployment with CI/CD

---

## **Phase 11: Exploring Advanced Concepts**
